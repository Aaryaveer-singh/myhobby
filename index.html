        Coding is my hobby because coding is used in apps, games, webpages and also in robotics. This webpage is also made by using programming languages such as HTML and CSS. I have also created a calculator app. Ethical hacking also needs coding. Coding needs creativity and that's the best part of it. Once you are a pro, you can create whatever you want.
